## Machine Learning for Cardiac Health: Predicting Coronary Artery Disease 

## My colleague (George Baffuor Awuah) and I collaborated to work on this project together for our STATISTICAL COMPUTING final project at Ohio University.



## Abstract
This study evaluates the efficacy of multiple machine learning models in predicting coronary artery disease (CAD) using clinical data from the Sani dataset. We employed five different classification techniques: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest. Our analysis included a thorough assessment of each model based on accuracy, recall, F1 score, Area Under the Curve (AUC), and mean sensitivity. The results indicated that the Logistic Regression model outperformed others with an accuracy of 83.52%, an F1 score of 72.73%, and an AUC of 88.52%, demonstrating high effectiveness in distinguishing between patients with and without CAD. The Random Forest model also showed strong performance, especially in accuracy and AUC. Our findings highlight the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in enhancing diagnostic accuracy in medical settings, thereby supporting healthcare professionals in making more informed decisions regarding CAD management and guiding future research and clinical applications in cardiovascular disease diagnosis.Click  (xxxx)to see the codes and analysis we did in R Markdown.
