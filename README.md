I am a diligent scholar pursuing a Master of Arts in Economics at Ohio University, with a previous Master of Philosophy in Agricultural Economics from the University of Ghana. My diverse background spans research, teaching, and community development, showcasing my academic rigor and impactful leadership as a Graduate Research Assistant and Teaching Fellow.

I possess expertise in statistical analysis and a strong commitment to interdisciplinary collaboration. I am proficient in using R, Stata, SPSS, and Microsoft Excel to analyze data and provide insights for decision-making, and I am currently learning Python for further data analysis and insight provision.

As I near the completion of my studies in August and anticipate graduating in December, I am actively seeking entry-level and associate-level positions in economics and related fields, such as Research Analyst/Associate and Data Analyst. 

I am passionate about using my skills and knowledge to contribute to the field of economics and beyond, and I am eager to leverage my academic and professional experiences in a dynamic and impactful role.
